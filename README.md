# Welcome to the fuzzy suite

This is a short python notebook showcasing a suite of tools designed to translate between semantic content and programming primitives. It consists of 
- `fuzzy_if` - answers the question: is a string something
- `fuzzy_filter` - filters any kind or vibe of substring from a string
- `fuzzy_foreach` - fuzzy_filter + do something to each output 

There are example of how each one works in the notebook, and the code is quite straightforward. There is also a short test suite for `fuzzy_if`. If you run it (at least with gpt 3.5), you'll notice it doesn't score 100%, any improvements are welcome!
